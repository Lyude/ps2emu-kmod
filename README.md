ps2emu
======

ps2emu is a PS/2 emulation module for the Linux kernel. Using this module, one
is able to virtually emulate a PS/2 device from another computer, something
that is quite useful for people working on developing drivers for various PS/2
touchpads commonly found in laptops.

How do I try it?
